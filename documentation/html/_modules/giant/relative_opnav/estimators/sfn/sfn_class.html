<span class="sd">This module provides the capability to locate surface features from a target in an image using 2D cross-correlation.</span>

<span class="sd">Description of the Technique</span>
<span class="sd">----------------------------</span>

<span class="sd">When a target grows to the point where we can begin to distinguish individual features on the surface in the images, we</span>
<span class="sd">typically consider switching to navigating using these features instead of just the center of figure of the target.</span>
<span class="sd">There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that as the body grows in the field of view and errors in</span>
<span class="sd">your shape model can start contributing to larger and larger errors in your center-finding results and the fact that</span>
<span class="sd">having multiple observations instead of a single puts a stronger constraint on the location of the camera at each image</span>
<span class="sd">allowing us to more accurately estimate the trajectory of the camera through time.</span>

<span class="sd">One of the most common ways of extracting observations of each feature is through cross correlation, using a very</span>
<span class="sd">similar technique to that describe in :mod:`.cross_correlation`.  Essentially we render what we think each feature will</span>
<span class="sd">look like based on the current knowledge of the relative position and orientation of the camera with respect to each</span>
<span class="sd">feature (the features are stored in a special catalogue called a :class:`.FeatureCatalogue`).  We then take the rendered</span>
<span class="sd">template and use normalized cross correlation to identify the location of the feature in the image.  After we have</span>
<span class="sd">identified the features in the image, we optionally solve a PnP problem to refine our knowledge of the spacecraft state</span>
<span class="sd">and then repeat the process to correct any errors in the observations created by errors in our initial state estimates.</span>

<span class="sd">In more detail, GIANT implements this using the following steps</span>

<span class="sd">#. Identify which features we think should be visible in the image using the :attr:`.FeatureCatalogue.feature_finder`</span>
<span class="sd">#. For each feature we predict should be visible, render the template based on the a priori relative state between the</span>
<span class="sd">   camera and the feature using a single bounce ray trace and the routines from :mod:`.ray_tracer`.</span>
<span class="sd">#. Perform 2D normalized cross correlation for every possible alignment between the center of the templates and the</span>
<span class="sd">   image.  We do this in a search region specified by the user and usually in the spatial domain so that we can include</span>
<span class="sd">   information about which pixels we want to consider when computing the correlation scores, as described in</span>
<span class="sd">   :func:`.sfn_correlator`.</span>
<span class="sd">#. Locate the peaks of the correlation surfaces (optionally locate the subpixel peak by fitting a 2D quadric to the</span>
<span class="sd">   correlation surface)</span>
<span class="sd">#. Correct the located peaks based on the location of the center-of-feature in the template to get the</span>
<span class="sd">   observed center-of-feature in the image.</span>
<span class="sd">#. Optionally solve the PnP problem for the best shift/rotation of the feature locations in the camera frame to minimize</span>
<span class="sd">   the residuals between the predicted feature locations and the observed feature locations.  Once complete, update the</span>
<span class="sd">   knowledge of the relative position/orientation of the camera with respect to the target and repeat all steps except</span>
<span class="sd">   this one to correct for errors introduced by a priori state knowledge errors.</span>

<span class="sd">Tuning</span>
<span class="sd">------</span>

<span class="sd">There are a few more tuning options in SFN verses normal cross correlation.  The first, and likely most important</span>
<span class="sd">tuning is for identifying potentially visible features in an image.  For this, you actually want to set the</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.FeatureCatalogue.feature_finder` attribute to be something that will correctly determine which features are</span>
<span class="sd">possibly visible (typically to an instance of :class:`.VisibleFeatureFinder`).  We discuss the tuning for the</span>
<span class="sd">:class:`.VisibleFeatureFinder` here, though you could concievably use something else if you desired.</span>

<span class="sd">========================================================= ==============================================================</span>
<span class="sd">Parameter                                                 Description</span>
<span class="sd">========================================================= ==============================================================</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.off_boresight_angle_maximum` The maximum angle between the boresight of the camera and the</span>
<span class="sd">                                                          feature location in the camera frame in degrees.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.gsd_scaling`                 The permissible ratio of the camera ground sample distance to</span>
<span class="sd">                                                          the feature ground sample distance</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.reflectance_angle_maximum`   The maximum angle between the viewing vector and the average</span>
<span class="sd">                                                          normal vector of the feature in degrees.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.incident_angle_maximum`      The maximum angle between the incoming light vector and the</span>
<span class="sd">                                                          average feature normal vector in degrees.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.percent_in_fov`              The percentage of the feature that is in the FOV</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`.VisibleFeatureFinder.feature_list`                A list of feature names to consider</span>
<span class="sd">========================================================= ==============================================================</span>

<span class="sd">When tuning the feature finder you generally are looking to only get features that are likely to actually correlate well</span>
<span class="sd">in the image so that you don&#39;t waste time considering features that won&#39;t work for one reason or another.  All of these</span>
<span class="sd">parameters can contribute to this, but some of the most important are the ``gsd_scaling``, which should typically be</span>
<span class="sd">around 2 and the ``off_boresight_angle_maximum`` which should typically be just a little larger than the half diagonal</span>
<span class="sd">field of view of the detector to avoid possibly overflowing values in the projection computation and processing features</span>
<span class="sd">that are actually way outside the field of view.  Note that since you set the feature finder on each feature catalogue,</span>
<span class="sd">this means that you can have different tunings for different feature catalogues (if you have multiple in a scene).</span>

<span class="sd">Next we have the parameters that control the actual rendering/correlation for each feature.  These are the same as for</span>
<span class="sd">:mod:`.cross_correlation`.</span>

<span class="sd">================================================ =======================================================================</span>
<span class="sd">Parameter                                        Description</span>
<span class="sd">================================================ =======================================================================</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.brdf`           The bidirectional reflectance distribution function used to compute the</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 expected illumination of a ray based on the geometry of the scene.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.grid_size`      The size of the grid to use for subpixel sampling when rendering the</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 templates</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.peak_finder`    The function to use to detect the peaks of the correlation surfaces.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.blur`           A flag specifying whether to blur the correlation surfaces to decrease</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 high frequency noise before identifying the peak.</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.search_region`  The search region in pixels to restrict the area the peak of</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 the correlation surfaces is searched for around the a priori predicted</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 centers for each feature</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.min_corr_score` The minimum correlation score to accept as a successful identification.</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 Correlation scores range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect</span>
<span class="sd">                                                 correlation.</span>
<span class="sd">================================================ =======================================================================</span>

<span class="sd">Of these options, most only make small changes to the results.  The 2 that can occasionally make large changes are</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.search_region` and :attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.blur`.  In general</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.search_region` should be set to a few pixels larger than the expected uncertainty in</span>
<span class="sd">the camera/feature relative state. Since we are doing spatial correlation here we typically want this number to be as</span>
<span class="sd">small as possible for efficiency while still capturing the actual peak. The :attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.blur`</span>
<span class="sd">attribute can also be used to help avoid mistaken correlation (perhaps were only empty space is aligned).  Finally, the</span>
<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.min_corr_score` can generally be left at the default, though if you have a poor a</span>
<span class="sd">priori knowledge of either the shape model or the relative position of the features then you may need to decrease this</span>
<span class="sd">some.</span>

<span class="sd">The last set of tuning parameters to consider are those for the PnP solver.  They are as follows:</span>

<span class="sd">=============================================================== ========================================================</span>

<span class="sd">:attr:`~SurfaceFeatureNavigation.second_search_region`          The search region in pixels to restrict the area the</span>

<span class="sd">=============================================================== ========================================================</span>

<span class="sd">All of these options can be important.  First, unless you have very good a priori error, you probably should turn the</span>
<span class="sd">PnP solver on.  Because of the way SFN works, errors in your a priori state can lead to somewhat significant errors in</span>
<span class="sd">the observed feature locations, and the PnP solver can correct a lot of these errors.  If you do turn the PnP solver on</span>
<span class="sd">then the rest of these options become important.  The ``pnp_ransac_iterations`` should typically be set to something</span>
<span class="sd">around 100-200, especially if you expect there to be outliers (which there usually are).  The ``second_search_distance``</span>
<span class="sd">should be set to capture the expected uncertainty after the PnP solution (typically mostly just the uncertainty in the</span>
<span class="sd">camera model and the uncertainty in the feature locations themselves).  Typically something around 5 works well.  The</span>
<span class="sd">``*_sigma`` attributes control the relative weighting between the a priori state and the observed locations, which can</span>
<span class="sd">be important to get a good PnP solution.  The ``max_lsq_iterations`, ``lsq_relative_error_tolerance``, and</span>
<span class="sd">``lsq_relative_update_tolerance`` can play an important role in getting the PnP solver to converge, though the defaults</span>
<span class="sd">are generally decent.  Finally, the ``cf_results`` and ``cf_index`` can help to decrease errors in the a priori relative</span>
<span class="sd">state knowledge, which in some cases can be critical to successfully identifying features.</span>

<span class="sd">        This method identifies the locations of surface features in the image through cross correlation of rendered</span>
<span class="sd">        templates with the image.</span>

<span class="sd">        This method first checks to ensure that the appropriate correlator is set for the :attr:`image_processing`</span>
<span class="sd">        instance (which should the :func:`.sfn_correlator`).  If it is not a warning is printed and we set the</span>
<span class="sd">        correlator to be the :func:`.sfn_correlator` (this is required for surface feature navigation).  Don&#39;t worry,</span>
<span class="sd">        we&#39;ll put things back the way they were when we&#39;re done :).</span>

<span class="sd">        This method also identifies the index into the :attr:`.Camera.images` list for the image being processed. This</span>
<span class="sd">        is done by first checking identity (to find the exact same image). If that doesn&#39;t work we then check based on</span>
<span class="sd">        equality (the pixel data is all exactly the same) however, this could lead to false pairing in some degenerate</span>
<span class="sd">        instances.  As long as you are using this method as intended (and not copying/modifying the image array from the</span>
<span class="sd">        camera before sending it to this method) the identity check should work.  We do this so that we can relocate</span>
<span class="sd">        each target to be along the line of sight vector found by center finding (if done/provided) before looking for</span>
<span class="sd">        features.  Therefore if you aren&#39;t seeding your SFN with center finding results you don&#39;t need to worry about</span>
<span class="sd">        this.</span>

<span class="sd">        Once the initial preparation is complete, for each requested target that is a :class:`.FeatureCatalogue` we seek</span>
<span class="sd">        feature locations that are visible in the image. This is done by first predicting which features from the</span>
<span class="sd">        catalogue should be visible in the image using the a priori relative state knowledge between the camera and the</span>
<span class="sd">        feature catalogue and the :attr:`.FeatureCatalogue.feature_finder` function which is usually an instance of</span>
<span class="sd">        :class:`.VisibleFeatureFinder`.  Once potentially visible features have been determined, we render a predicted</span>
<span class="sd">        template of each feature using a single bounce ray tracer.  We then do spatial cross correlation between the</span>
<span class="sd">        template and the image within a specified search region (if the search region is too large we attempt global</span>
<span class="sd">        frequency correlation first) to generate a correlation surface.  From this correlation surface, we identify the</span>
<span class="sd">        peak and use that to locate the center of the feature in the image.  Once this has been completed for all</span>
<span class="sd">        potentially visible features for a given target, we then optionally attempt to solve a PnP problem to refine the</span>
<span class="sd">        relative position and orientation of the camera with respect to the target based on the observed feature</span>
<span class="sd">        locations.  If we successfully solve the PnP problem, then we iterate 1 more time through the entire process</span>
<span class="sd">        (but not the PnP solver) and the results from that time become the observed locations stored in the</span>
<span class="sd">        :attr:`observed_bearings` attribute.</span>

<span class="sd">        More details about many of these steps can be seen in the :meth:`render` and :meth:`pnp_solver` methods.</span>

<span class="sd">        .. warning::</span>
<span class="sd">            Before calling this method be sure that the scene has been updated to correspond to the correct</span>

<span class="sd">        This method attempts to solve for an update to the relative position/orientation of the target with respect to</span>
<span class="sd">        the image based on the observed feature locations in the image.</span>

<span class="sd">        We solve the PnP problem here looking for an update (ie not trying to solve the lost in space problem).  This is</span>
<span class="sd">        done for 2 reasons.  First, it reflects what we&#39;re doing.  In order to find the surface features in the image we</span>
<span class="sd">        need some reasonable a priori knowledge of the relative position/orientation between the camera and the target</span>
<span class="sd">        so we might as well use it (since it makes things simpler).  Second, because the PnP problem can be fickle,</span>
<span class="sd">        especially if the observations are noisy (as they can sometimes be if our a priori knowledge was not the</span>
<span class="sd">        greatest) by solving for an update we force it to stay near the a priori knowledge which helps to prevent</span>
<span class="sd">        outlandish solutions, even when there are very few points available.</span>

<span class="sd">        Because we are doing an update PnP solution we simply solve a nonlinear least squares problem for the</span>
<span class="sd">        translation and rotation (cast as a 3 element rotation vector) that minimizes the error between the predicted</span>
<span class="sd">        feature locations in the image and the observed feature locations.  This is generally robust and fast,</span>
<span class="sd">        especially since we can easily compute the analytic Jacobian for the least squares problem.  Specifically, the</span>
<span class="sd">        problem we are trying to minimize is</span>

<span class="sd">        .. math::</span>

<span class="sd">            \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{y}_i-f\left((\mathbf{I}-[\boldsymbol{\delta\theta}\times])</span>
<span class="sd">            (\mathbf{x}_i+\mathbf{d})\right) \\</span>
<span class="sd">            \min_{\mathbf{d},\boldsymbol{\delta\theta}}\left\{\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i^T\mathbf{r}_i\right\}</span>

<span class="sd">        where :math:`\mathbf{d}` is the shift, :math:`\boldsymbol{\delta\theta}` is the rotation vector,</span>
<span class="sd">        :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` is the observed location of the :math:`i^{th}` features, :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` is the</span>
<span class="sd">        location of the :math:`i^{th}` feature center in the current a priori camera frame, :math:`\mathbf{I}` is a</span>
<span class="sd">        3x3 identity matrix, and :math:`f(\bullet)` is the function which transforms points in the camera frame to</span>
<span class="sd">        points in the image (:meth:`.CameraModel.project_onto_image`).</span>

<span class="sd">        In addition, we provide the option to use RANSAC when solving the PnP problem to attempt to reject outliers in</span>
<span class="sd">        the solution.  This is very useful and should typically be used when possible (RANSAC will not be used when the</span>
<span class="sd">        number of observed features is less than 8).  We implement a typical RANSAC algorithm, where we choose a</span>
<span class="sd">        subsample of the available measurements, compute the PnP solution using the sample, and then compute the</span>
<span class="sd">        statistics/number of inliers from the full set of measurements given the estimated location from the sample,</span>
<span class="sd">        keeping the one with the most inliers and lowest statistics.</span>

<span class="sd">        To apply the results of this method to a scene object you should do ``object.translate(shift)`` and then</span>
<span class="sd">        ``object.rotate(rotation)`` where ``object`` is the scene object, ``shift`` is the shift vector from this</span>
<span class="sd">        method, and ``rotation`` is the rotation from this method (note translate first, then rotate).</span>

<span class="sd">        :param target_ind: The index of the target that we are currently doing the PnP problem with respect to</span>
<span class="sd">        :param image: The image that we are currently solving the PnP problem for</span>
<span class="sd">        :param image_ind: The index of the image that we are solving the PnP problem for. (This only really matters if</span>
<span class="sd">                          you still have per image misalignments in your camera model still for some reason)</span>
<span class="sd">        :return: The best fit shift as a length 3 numpy array in km and rotation as a :class:`.Rotation` to go from the</span>
<span class="sd">                 current camera frame to the new camera frame if successful or ``None``, ``None``</span>
