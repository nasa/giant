===============

GIANT is an API for performing many different types of optical navigation quickly and easily. It provides high level
classes that perform the most common OpNav tasks with little user involvement, while still making many of the
lower level calls easily accessible to allow for more advanced techniques to be quickly built.  This tutorial will
introduce you to the basic user-level interface for GIANT.  Walk through the following sections in order to see what its
about (use can use the navigation bars at the top/bottom of each page to move through the tutorial).
