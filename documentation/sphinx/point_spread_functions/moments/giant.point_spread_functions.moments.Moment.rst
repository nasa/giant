    .. attribute:: save_residuals
        :value: False

        This class attribute specifies whether to save the residuals when fitting the specified PSF to data.

        Saving the residuals can be important for in depth analysis but can use a lot of space when many fits are being
        performed and stored so this defaults to off.  To store the residuals simply set this to ``True`` either before or
        after initialization.
