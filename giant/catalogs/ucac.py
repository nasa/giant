This module defines the interface to the UCAC4 star catalog.

Catalog Description
=====================

The UCAC4 is a catalog of 113 million stars with 105 million including proper motion solutions.  It is complete to
about a magnitude of 16.  It is generally very accurate for positions, but less so for magnitudes.

The UCAC 4 uses a file based database system that is fast for small queries, but can be slow for queries over a large
area.  It also does not include blended stars (stars that are close enough that they appear as a single star in an
image).  If you need faster retrieval and/or blended stars then you should use the :mod:`.giant_catalog` instead,
which is built primarily using the UCAC4 catalog.

Use
===

The UCAC4 catalog can be used anywhere that a star catalog is required in GIANT.
It is stored in a number of index and binary data files on disk and takes about 9 GB of space.  If you attempt to
initialize the class and point it to a directory that does not contain the UCAC4 data it will ask you if you want to
download the catalog (note that the UCAC4 data is not included by default so if you have not downloaded it yourself
you will definitely need to).  If you answer yes, be aware that it may take a very long time to download.

Once you have initialized the class (and downloaded the data files), then you can access the catalog as you would any
GIANT usable catalog.  Simply call :meth:`~.UCAC4.query_catalog` to get the GIANT records for the stars as a
dataframe with columns according the :attr:`.GIANT_COLUMNS`.  This class also provides 2 helper methods,
:meth:`~.UCAC4.query_catalog_raw` which can be used to retrieve the raw catalog entries (instead of the GIANT
entries) and :meth:`~.UCAC4.cross_ref_tycho` which can be used to get the raw Tycho 2 catalog records for a UCAC4
star (if available).

class UCAC4(Catalog):

    This class provides access to the UCAC4 star catalog.

    This class is a fully functional catalog for GIANT and can be used anywhere that GIANT expects a star catalog.
    As such, it implements the :attr:`include_proper_motion` to turn proper motion on or off as well as the method
    :meth:`query_catalog` which is how stars are queried into the GIANT format.  In addition, this catalog provides
    2 additional methods :meth:`cross_ref_tycho` and :meth:`query_catalog_raw` to get the corresponding Tycho 2 record
    for the input stars or the raw UCAC4 records. These methods aren't used anywhere by GIANT itself, but may be useful
    if you are doing some advanced analysis.

    To use this class simply initialize it, pointing to the directory where the u4b and u4i catalog directories are
    contained.  If the catalog files do not exist it will ask you if you want to download them, and if you answer yes,
    it will download the UCAC4 catalog (which takes a long time in most instances).  Once the class is initialized,
    you can query stars from it using :meth:`query_catalog` which will return a dataframe of the star records with
    :attr:`.GIANT_COLUMNS` columns.

    This helper function does a binary search on a sorted file with fixed width lines.

    The binary search is performed by successively checking the midpoint between the current block of the file under
    consideration and using it to determine whether to search to the left or right of the midpoint for the next
    iteration.  As such, this requires the lines to be sorted on the column that is being searched.  This also requires
    that the column being searched is orderable (implements comparison operators) after conversion from a string.

    The conversion into an orderable type is controlled using the ``column_conversion`` keyword argument.  This is
    applied to the specified column (controlled by keyword arguments ``column`` and ``separator``) to create an
    orderable object.  This can be any callable, so long as it returns an orderable object, but typically is a python
    type like ``int`` or ``float``.  Note that strings are orderable as well, therefore you can make
    ``column_conversion`` ``str``, however be aware that the ordering of strings can be confusing when white space is
    involved (for instance ``'10'`` is less than ``'2'`` according to string comparisons).  Therefore, unless your
    numbers are 0 padded (ie ``'02'``), we recommend using a numeric type for the ``column_conversion``.

    If the searched for label is found in the column then the line in which it is found is returned (as a bytes object).
    If it is not found then ``None`` is returned.

    :param file: The file object to search.  This should be opened in binary read mode so that we can seek
    :param label: the label we are searching for in the file object.  This must support equality comparison (==) with
                  the type that is returned by ``column_conversion``.
    :param column: the column index that is to be searched
    :param separator: The separator spec for splitting the file.  If ``None`` then defaults to white space.  This is
                      passed directly to ``str.split``
    :param column_conversion: The callable to convert the column into an orderable object.  Typically this should be one
                              of the python builtin types (like ``float`` or ``int``) but it can be ay callable so long
                              as the return supports less than/greater than operators.  This is applied as
                              ``column_conversion(line.split(sep=separator))`` where ``line`` is the current line under
                              consideration.
    :param order: How the column being searched is sorted.  This should be either ``ASCENDING`` or ``DESCENDING`` (one
                  of the :class:`ColumnOrder` enum values)

                  the file
    :param stop: Where to stop the search in bytes.  If this is ``None`` then  it will be set to the length of the file.
