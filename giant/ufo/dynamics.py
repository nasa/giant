"""
This module defines dynamics models to be used in an EKF for propagating the state and covariance of an estimated
target.

Description
-----------

The dynamics specify how the target is expected to move in space given initial conditions.  They are usually specified
as an ODE initial value problem and integrated numerically, although for simple cases a few closed for analytic
solutions exist. These models are generally used by the :mod:`extended_kalman_filter` module in order to link
observations together and to propagate the state from one time to the next.

Use
---

This module defines 3 classes for defining Dynamics models.  The first, :class:`.Dynamics` is an abstract base class
that provides a template for creating a new dynamics model in GIANT.ufo.  If you want to create your own custom model,
you should subclass this and implement/update the :attr:`.Dynamics.State` class describing the state vector for your
model, and the abstract methods defined by the abstract class.  If you do this then you will be able to use your
dynamics model in the EKF (presuming your dynamics model works and describes what it going on).

Alternatively, the there are 2 basic dynamics models provided in this module which you can use directly or subclass and
extend with more features.  The first :class:`SpiceGravityDynamics` implements a simple n-body problem dynamics model
assuming point mass gravity, using NAIF spice to query the n-body positions at each integration step.  The second,
:class:`SolRadAndGravityDynamics` adds cannonball model solar radiation pressure to the simple n-body gravity model.
These 2 simple dynamics models are generally sufficient for most things you'll be tracking in UFO and thus can be used
directly.  They also serve as examples for implementing/extending your own dynamics models.

    This class implements a simple N-Body gravity dynamics model using Spice as the source of the planet locations.

    To use this class, specify the central (primary body) as well as any bodies/barycenters you want to include as
    n-body sources through the ``center_body`` and ``other_bodies`` arguments respectively.  The class will then
    automatically compute the gravity for you.  Note that you should not include the central body in the list of n-body
    perturbations.

    By default, this class will retrieve the GM values from spice for each body/barycenter being considered.  You can
    override these values by specifying the key word argument ``gravity_parameters`` which should be a dictionary
    mapping the name of the planet to the gravity parameter.

    This class can optionally furnsh the planetary ephemeris and planetary constants files for you if you so desire.
    This is controlled through key word argument ``load_data``.  If you provide this option, the class will attempt to
    locate the files in the ``data`` directory in the directory containing this file.  If it cannot find the files there
    then it will ask you if it can download them from the naif site.  If you have already loaded kernels that provide
    the required data (namely the name of the planets, the planetary GM (unless you are providing your own)), and the
    locations of the planets) then you should leave this option off as it could override the values you have already
    loaded.

    The covariance in this dynamics model is integrated directly instead of using the state transformation matrix
    (because that is how I learned EKFs...).  This means that the process noise is added to the covariance derivative
    directly (which may be different from what many are use to).  Therefore be sure you carefully consider how to set
    the process noise when using this class.

    squared, :math:`\Phi` the the solar constant at 1 AU in kW/m**2, :math:`c` is the speed of light in m/s**2,
    :math:`m` is the mass of the spacecraft in kg, :math:`d_{sun}` is the distance from the sun in AU, and
    :math:`\hat{\mathbf{s}}` is the unit vector from the sun to the spacecraft.

    ``cram`` that is estimated in the filter.  If you want to back out one of the parameters from this estimated value,
