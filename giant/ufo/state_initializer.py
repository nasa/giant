"""
This module provides a working example state initializer callable for use with the :class:`.ExtendedKalmanFilter`.

Description
-----------

A state initializer is a Callable object which takes in the initial :class:`.Measurement` instance and the
:class:`.Dynamics.State` class object and returns an initialized :class:`.Dynamics.State` with position, velocity,
covariance and other state parameters filled in.  This callable can either be a function or a class which implements the
``__call__`` method, although it is more typically implemented as a class to enable easy changing of parameters.

Use
---

The process of initializing the state from a measurement will likely be different in every scenario, so the provided
initializer really just serves as an example (taken from the OSIRIS-REx particle tracking code) for building your own.
If your case is sufficiently similar to the OSIRIS-REx case then you can use this initializer directly (it is fully
functional) by supplying an instance of it to the :class:`.ExtendedKalmanFilter` class.
