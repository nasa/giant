This module provides scene functionality for rendering in GIANT.

Description
-----------

In GIANT, a scene is used to describe the location and orientation of objects with respect to each other and some
defined frame (usually the camera frame) at a given moment in time.  This then facilitates rendering multiple objects
in a scene, doing single bounce ray tracing to a light source, and other similar tasks. Additionally, the scene makes it
easy to tie functions that specify the location/orientation of an object at given times so that they can be used to
automatically place things in the scene at a requested image time.

Use
---

To use the scene in GIANT you simply create :class:`.SceneObject` instances for any targets and the light source for
your scene (currently only a single light source is allowed).  You then create a :class:`.Scene` around these objects.
This then gives you the ability to call the most commonly used methods of the scene :meth:`.Scene.trace` to trace rays
through all of the targets in the scene and :meth:`.Scene.get_illumination_inputs` to do a single bounce ray trace and
create the inputs required to estimate the intensity for each rendered ray using :mod:`.illumination`.

In general, besides initializing your :class:`.Scene` and :class:`.SceneObject` instances, you won't interact directly
with the scene classes much, as this is done for you in the rest of GIANT.

class SceneObject:
    """
    This class provides a quick and easy interface for changing the position and orientation of various objects.

    Essentially, this class adds position and orientation attributes to shapes, rays, KDTrees, and other objects that
    can be translated and rotated.  It also adds optional orientation and position functions, which can be used to
    automatically set the position/orientation for this object at a given time using :meth:`place`.  This makes it much
    easier to perform frame transformations as the current frame's orientation and origin are stored with the object.
    The position and orientation are specified with respect to the
    default fixed frame for the object, which is usually [0, 0, 0] and eye(3) respectively.

    This class also provides 5 methods for updating the objects contained.

    * :meth:`change_position` - changes the position of the origin of the frame the object is expressed in.  This works
                                by first resetting the origin to 0 by subtracting off the previous origin, and then
                                setting the new origin at the specified location.  This is good when you are completely
                                changing the frame the object is expressed in.
    * :meth:`translate` - This is similar to :func:`change_position` but it does not first reset the origin to 0.  This
                          is good for making updates to the frame the object is expressed in.
    * :meth:`change_orientation` - Changes the orientation of the frame the object is expressed in by first
                                   resetting the orientation to be the identity matrix by rotating by the inverse
                                   transformation of the previous orientation, and then rotating to the new orientation
                                   specified.  This is good for when you are completely changing the frame the object is
                                   expressed in.
    * :meth:`rotate` - This is similar to :func:`change_orientation` but it does not first reset the orientation to the
                       identity.  This method is good for making updates to the frame the object is expressed in.
    * :meth:`place` - This automatically updates the orienation and position of the object based on the provided
                      :attr:`orientation_function` and :attr:`position_function`.  If either of these are still ``None``
                      then this will print a warning to the screen and do nothing

    Note that this class does not intelligently relate frames to each other, that must be done by the user.

    The following shows an example use of the SceneObj type.  First, we want to change the frame we have the rays
    expressed in.

    Start by doing your imports and setting up your ray in the camera frame:

        >>> import giant.ray_tracer.rays as g_rays
        >>> import giant.ray_tracer.scene as g_scene
        >>> from giant.rotations import Rotation
        >>> import numpy
        >>> ray = g_rays.Rays([0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 0])

    Now, lets define a position and orientation function.  Here for demo purposes we'll just return constant values,
    though most commonly these are generated as spice function calls

        >>> def position_function(date):
        ...     return numpy.array([-5, 6, 7])
        >>> def orientation_function(date):
        ...     return Rotation([0.5, 2, -3.2])

    Now we can create our SceneObj around the ray:

        >>> scene_obj = g_scene.SceneObject(ray, position_function=position_function,
        ...                                 orientation_function=orientation_function)

    Note here, that we are defining the default frame for the ray to be the current frame that it is in (the camera
    frame).  This means that whenever we want to **change** the frame (not update) for the rays we need to specify the
    new origin and orientation with respect to the camera frame.  Let's change our rays to some new frame:

        >>> new_loc = [1, 2, 3]  # the new origin location expressed in the original frame
        >>> new_orientation = [4, 5, 6]  # the new orientation of the new frame with respect to the original frame

    First, we'll update the origin of the frame (we are assuming that new_loc is expressed in the camera frame here):

        >>> scene_obj.change_position(new_loc)
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [ 1.  2.  3.]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ -1.  0.  0.]

    Now, we'll change the orientation:

        >>> scene_obj.change_orientation(new_orientation)
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [ 1.98283723  2.55366624  1.88338665]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ 0.42296095 -0.05284171 -0.90460588]

    Now lets say we want to update the current frame our ray is expressed in:

        >>> update_pos = [0.05, -1, 0.2]  # where we want to move the current origin to expressed in the current frame
        >>> scene_obj.translate(update_pos)
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [ 2.03283723  1.55366624  2.08338665]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ 0.42296095 -0.05284171 -0.90460588

    Note how this was added to the current frame, not reset back from the original frame:

        >>> update_orientation = [0.001, 0.001, 0.001]
        >>> scene_obj.rotate(update_orientation)
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [ 2.0323073   1.55371729  2.08386553]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ 0.42381181 -0.05416946 -0.90412898]

    Now, lets use the position function and orientation function we provided to update the rays position/orientation
    automatically

        >>> scene_obj.place(datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc))
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [-5.  6.  7.]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ 0.75609837 -0.64204013 -0.12688471]

    And finally, lets say that we want to return our ray to the initial frame:

        >>> scene_obj.change_position([0, 0, 0])
        >>> scene_obj.change_orientation(numpy.eye(3))
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.start)
        [ 0.  0.  0.]
        >>> print(scene_obj.shape.direction)
        [ -1.  0.  0.]

    Typically when using the :attr:`position_function` and :attr:`orientation_function` these should give the position
    of the object relative to the solar system bary center in the inertial frame and the rotation from the object fixed
    frame to the inertial frame respectively.  This will then pair well with updating the scene to put everying in the
    camera frame if you also put the inertial camera position and rotation from the intertial frame to the camera frame
    on the :class:`.OpNavImage` as is typical.  You can conceivably work differently than this but it is then up to you
    to ensure all of your definitions are consistent.

    In addition to making it easy to move objects around in the scene, the :class:`.SceneObject` class also provides
    some useful methods for getting information about the object in the current scene.  This includes
    :meth:`get_bounding_pixels` which determines the extent of the object in the image (this only works once the object
    has been rotated/translated into the camera frame) and :meth:`get_apparent_diamter` which predicts the apparent
    diameter of the object in pixels in the image (this also only works once the object
    has been rotated/translated into the camera frame).

        the intersection with the minimum distance between the ray and the camera.
