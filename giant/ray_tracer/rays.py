This module defines a class for representing rays in GIANT, a function to generate them from a camera model, and the
numpy structured data type used to store the results of a ray trace.

Description
-----------

In GIANT, A :class:`.Rays` is used in ray tracing to intersect with a surface.  It is defined fully by a start, a
direction, and an inverse direction (1/direction).  Rays are defined to be efficient in GIANT, making use of numpy
broadcasting so that you can efficiently have a single start for many directions or many starts for a single direction,
and also support translation and rotation like other ray tracer objects.

Use
---

Rays are used frequently in GIANT.  They're pretty simple to create (simply provide the start and direction as numpy
arrays) and can be directly created for pixels from a camera in the camera frame using :func:`.compute_rays`.  Once
they're created they can be used for tracing :mod:`.shapes`, :class:`.KDTree`, :class:`.Scene`, and
:class:`.SceneObject` and for generating illumination inputs.  In addition, you can ignore certain facets (for surfaces)
or entire solids when tracing rays, using the :attr:`.ignore` attribute of the :class:`.Rays` class.  The format that
the ids for the ignore attribute take are somewhat complicated, so be sure to read the documentation carefully if you
are planning to use this feature.

class Rays:
    """
    A class to store/manipulate rays.

    In GIANT a ray is defined by a start and a direction (and optionally a list of ids to ignore when tracing a ray
    through a scene/to a shape.  In addition, given these inputs, this class automatically computes the inverse
    direction (1/direction) which is used when intersecting the rays with an axis aligned bounding box.

    When creating rays, if you are creating multiple rays that share the same :attr:`start` or the same
    :attr:`direction` you should input these as a single array of length 3 (not 3x1).  This will allow us to use
    numpy broadcasting rules to efficiently represent the rays without having to duplicate memory.  In addition, you can
    update the start/direction of the rays by using the :meth:`rotate` and :meth:`translate` methods, or by setting to
    the :attr:`start` and :attr:`direction` directly.

    To use the :attr:`ignore` attribute of the rays you need to encode the full id of whatever you are trying to ignore.
    This can be very tricky and depends on what your tracing the rays against.  For instance, if you are directly
    tracing the rays with a :class:`.RawSurface` like a :class:`.Triangle64` then the id is simply the facet number (row
    number in the :attr:`.RawSurface.facets` array).  If you are tracing with a :class:`.Solid`, then the id is the
    :attr:`.Solid.id`.  If you are tracing with a :class:`.KDTree` then the id needs to be a combination of the ids of
    the path through the tree to the leaf node containing the facet, plus the row number for the facet in the
    :attr:`.KDNode.surface` of the leaf node (this can conveniently be determined using :func:`.get_ignore_inds`).  If
    you are tracing with a scene, then you need to take the id of the geometry combined with index of the scene object
    in the :attr:`.Scene.target_objs` list.  All of these get combined into a single integer.  Given this, it is rare to
    set the :attr:`ignore` attribute yourself.  Instead, typically you either let GIANT set the attribute for you
    automatically, or you get the value from a previous trace (the ``facet`` component of :data:`.INTERSECT_DTYPE` will
    fully encode the id for whatever you traced through).

    This class supports iterating through rays one at a time using the normal python syntax (``for ray in rays: ...``).
    That being said, this is not super efficient and is not the way GIANT handles multiple rays internally.  You can
    also use indexing on the :class:`.Rays` object, which will return another :class:`.Rays` object.  This can be useful
    for things like boolean indexing and slicing.
