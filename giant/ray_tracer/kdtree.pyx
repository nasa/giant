This cython module provides the ability to accelerate ray tracing of :class:`.RawSurface` objects in GIANT.

Description
-----------

One of the most common ways to represent a 3D object is a tessellated surface made up of small, planar geometry
primitives (usually triangles).  This allows great freedom in specifying the shape of arbitrary objects at various
ground sample distances, however, because it usually takes many geometry primitives (on the order of tens of
thousands to millions) to represent objects with sufficient accuracy, ray tracing these surfaces can quickly become
prohibitively expensive (tracing thousands of rays against many geometry primitives requires a ton of work).  Therefore,
we need a way to accelerate the ray tracing of surfaces by limiting the number of geometry primitives we need to check
for each ray.  This is done through the :class:`.KDTree`.

A KDTree (or k-dimensional tree) is an acceleration structure where geometry primitives are split into smaller and
smaller groups as you traverse down the tree. These groups are represented by :class:`.KDNode`, where each node
contains either "left" and "right" children nodes (in which case it is called a branch node), or a small collection of
geometry primitives (in which case it is called a leaf node), plus an axis aligned bounding box which fully contains the
children nodes (if a branch node) or the geometry primitives (if a leaf node).  In order to trace this structure then,
we first trace the bounding box of a node (which is much more efficient than tracing geometry primitives), which
tells us if we need to further consider the contents of the node of not.  If the ray does intersect the bounding box
then we proceed to trace the left and right children nodes (if this is a branch) or the geometry primitives (if this
is a leaf) contained in the node.  By doing this, we limit the number of ray-geometry primitive intersection tests that
we need to perform dramatically (many times to as low as <100), which saves a lot of computational efficiency (again,
since the ray-axis aligned bounding box check is so much more efficient than the ray-geometry primitive checks).

Use
---

Since the :class:`.KDTree` is simply an acceleration structure, you can use it anywhere in GIANT that you would use a
:class:`.Surface` (in fact, the :class:`.KDTree` inherits from the :class:`.Surface` to emphasize this point).  To do
this, simply build your tree (by giving it the :class:`.RawSurface` that you want to accelerate and then calling the
:meth:`.KDTree.build`), and then use the resulting tree as your target geometry.  The :class:`.KDTree` implements all
of the required methods for the :class:`.Surface`, including :meth:`.KDTree.trace`, :meth:`.KDTree.compute_intersect`,
:meth:`.KDTree.find_limbs`, :meth:`.KDTree.compute_limb_jacobian`, :meth:`.KDTree.rotate`, and
:meth:`.KDTree.translate`.

Because it can take a while to build the tree initially, especially for particularly large surfaces, it is recommended
that you save the tree to a file after building it the first time, and then for future use load from the file.  You can
do this using the :meth:`.KDTree.save` and :meth:`.KDTree.load` methods, or using the typical pickle interface from
Python.

It will likely be rare that you directly create a :class:`.KDTree` in your scripts and software when using GIANT, since
GIANT provides scripts that already build them for you and save the results to file, including :mod:`.ingest_shape`,
:mod:`.tile_shape`, and :mod:`.spc_to_feature_catalog`.  We therefore recommend that you look at these first to see
if they meet your needs.

    A class to represent a node in a :class:`.KDTree`

    A node represents a spatial subdivision of the geometry that is contained in the scene.  It is comprised of an axis
    aligned bounding box, specifying the extent of the geometry contained with the node and its children, along with
    references to its children (if any), the geometry contained locally in the node (if any), and a unique identity for
    the node in the tree.

    Nodes are not typically used directly by the user, instead you should interact with the :class:`.KDTree`, which acts
    as a container/manager for all of the nodes that make up a tree.

    Each node is described by a unique identifier :attr:`id`.  Typically, this identifier is encoded into a large
    integer of the following form

    .. code-block:: none

        xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy
        |--id--||facet#|
        |---id_order---|

    where :attr:`id` is the id of the node, ``facet#`` is reserved to specify a facet number within the node with a length
    of :attr:`order` digits, and there are a total of :attr:`id_order` digits used to represent the ids. This form is
    used for checking that we are not intersecting the same triangle again (due to finite precision issues) when we are
    doing a bounce or other tracing that starts already on the surface.  For more details on how this works refer to
    :meth:`.Scene.trace`.

    __init__(self, surface, max_depth=10, _root=None, _rotation=None, _position=None, _bounding_box=None, _reference_ellipsoid=None)

    A KD Tree representation for accelerated tracing of surface objects with many geometry primitives using axis aligned
    bounding box acceleration.

    A KD Tree is essentially a modifier on a :class:`.Surface` which makes it much more computationally efficient to
    trace without altering the results from the trace at all (that is tracing a :class:`.Surface` and a
    :class:`.KDTree` built for that surface will produce equivalent results.  The acceleration is performed by dividing
    the surface into local sub surfaces which much fewer primitives contained in them.  Each sub surface is then
    encapsulated by an :class:`.AxisAlignedBoundingBox` specifying the extent of the geometry contained in it. Each one
    of these subsurfaces is contained in a :class:`.KDNode`.

    The nodes are built hierarchically, so that there is one large node at the top (the :attr:`root` of the tree) and
    then exponentially divide as you descend the tree until you reach the nodes that contain actual geometry.  This
    structure allows very efficient tracing by dramatically decreasing the number of geometry primitives that must be
    traced for each ray.  The wikipedia article on kd trees provides a decent description of how they work
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) though our specific implementation varies slightly from what is described
    there.

    Conceptually, if you don't care about the details, the tree can be treated just like any other surface in GIANT.
    You can use it as a target for relative opnav, or trace rays through it however you see fit. Simply provide your
    :class:`.Surface`, call the :meth:`build` method, and then use the results in a :class:`.SceneObject`.  The only
    real setting you may need to worry about is the :attr:`max_depth` which specifies
    how many node levels you want to make before tracing the remaining geometry.  Typically you want to set this so that
    there are between 10-100 remaining geometry primitives inside of the final leaf nodes in the tree (this information
    is provided to you if you use the :mod:`.ingest_shape` script). If you have too many geometry primitives remaining
    then your tree will be inefficient.  If you have too few geometry primitives remaining your tree will also be
    inefficient (it is sometimes a case of trial and error to find the optimal number).  Just remember that when
    adjusting this number that it is exponential.
