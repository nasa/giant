---

Typically a user doesn't directly interact with the objects in this module, since it is primarily used internally by the
ray tracer.  There are a few use cases though, as documented in the class documentation.

Note that you cannot render an :class:`.AxisAlignedBoundingBox` in an image because the returns from the
:meth:`.AxisAlignedBoundingBox.trace` method are not what is required.  If you need to render a box consider using
triangles to form the sides (the :attr:`.AxisAlignedBoundingBox.vertices` attribute can be useful for this purpose).

cdef class AxisAlignedBoundingBox:
    """
    __init__(self, min_sides, max_sides, _rotation=None)

    This class provides an efficient implementation of an axis aligned bounding box.

    An axis aligned bounding box is defined by 6 floats plus a rotation.  The first 3 floats specify the minimum values
    of the contained data for each axis (x, y, z) while the second 3 specify the maximum values for each axis.  The
    rotation defines the rotation from the current frame to the original frame the bounding box was built for, since the
    axis aligned bounding box is only valid in the original frame.

    The benefit to using an axis aligned bounding box is that it is very efficient to check intersection with a ray,
    which makes it a good choice for building acceleration structures (as is done in the :class:`.KDTree`).

    Typically a user doesn't create an AABB by themselves, especially since an AABB is not actually renderable (that is,
    you can't use it as a target in a scene).  Instead, each object has its own ``bounding_box`` attribute which is used
    internally by the ray tracer.

    To trace the bounding box, simply use the :meth:`.compute_intersect` or :meth:`trace` methods.  These will check
    whether the provided rays hit the bounding box, as well as the minimum/maximum distance from the ray origin that the
    intersection occurs at (if requested).  Note that this is different than other shapes in the ray tracer, hence why it
    can't be used for rendering.

    Additionally, users may find use for the :attr:`vertices` attribute.  This gives the 8 vertices of the corners of
    the AABB in the current frame, which can be useful for determining which pixels actually need to be traced for a
    given object.
