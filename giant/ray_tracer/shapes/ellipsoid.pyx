This cython module defines the :class:`.Ellipsoid` used for representing regular (well modelled by a tri-axial
ellipsoid) in GIANT.

Description
-----------

The :class:`.Ellipsoid` class is a fully functional and traceable object in GIANT, therefore it can be used in any of
the :mod:`.relative_opnav` techniques (with the exception of :mod:`.sfn`).  It represents the
object as a 3x3 matrix encoding of a triaxial ellipsoid (plus a 3 element center vector) and is very efficient for both
tracing and for finding limbs.  It is also well suited for use with the :mod:`.ellipse_matching` technique since that
technique assumes an ellipsoid.  Therefore, anytime your body is well represented by a triaxial ellipsoid you should
consider using this class.

For more details on how this class works, refer to the class documentation as follows.  Additionally, you can find great
information in the following paper and its references: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9326288 as well as
https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/41942/11-0589.pdf?sequence=1
both of which were used heavily in developing this class.

    __init__(self, center, principal_axes=None, orientation=None, ellipsoid_matrix=None, albedo_map=None, _bounding_box=None, _id=None)

    A shape for modelling spheres and triaxial ellipsoidal bodies.

    Most of the large objects in the solar system are generally ellipsoidal in shape.  Therefore, when rendering these
    objects it can be much more efficient to actually model them as a triaxial ellipsoid, which can generally be traced
    more efficiently than even a KDTree due to having only 1 surface to check.  Therefore, when you're dealing with a
    shape well modeled by a triaxial ellipsoid it is recommended that you use this class.

    This class works like other :class:`.Shape` classes in GIANT.  It provides :meth:`trace` and
    :meth:`compute_intersect` for calculating the intersect between the object and a ray. It provides methods
    :meth:`find_limbs` and :meth:`compute_limb_jacobian` to identify points along the limb of the target and how those
    points change when the location of the observer is changed.  In addition, it provides methods :meth:`rotate` and
    :meth:`translate` methods for moving the ellipsoid in the scene and an axis aligned bounding box in attribute
    :attr:`bounding_box`.

    In GIANT the triaxial ellipsoid is represented in matrix form, that is:

    .. math::

        \mathbf{A}_C = \mathbf{T}^{P}_{C}\left[\begin{array}{ccc} \frac{1}{a^2} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \frac{1}{b^2} & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & \frac{1}{c^2} \end{array}\right]\mathbf{T}_{P}^{C}

    Where :math:`\mathbf{A}_C` is the ellipsoid matrix in the current frame :math:`C`, :math:`\mathbf{T}^P_C` is the
    rotation matrix from the principal frame of the ellipsoid (:math:`P`, where the principal axes are aligned with the
    frame axes) to the current frame, and :math:`a\quad b\quad c` are the lengths of the principal axes of the
    ellipsoid.  From this class you can retrieve each component of the ellipsoid matrix.  :attr:`.ellipsoid_matrix`
    gives :math:`\mathbf{A}_C`, :attr:`.principal_axes` gives :math:`a\quad b\quad c\quad` as a length 3 array, and
    :attr:`orientation` gives :math:`\mathbf{T}_C^P` as a 3x3 rotation matrix.  In addition, the center of the ellipsoid
    in the current frame is in attribute :attr:`.center`.

    In addition to being its own object in a scene, the :class:`Ellipsoid` class is also used to represent the
    :attr:`.Surface.reference_ellipsoid` for a surface (used when doing limb based nav with irregular bodies in
    :mod:`.limb_matching` as well as the :attr:`.SceneObject.circumscribing_sphere` attribute of a scene object which
    is used to determine which pixels need traced for a specific object in the scene.

    To initialize this class, you can either provide the ellipsoid matrix itself (which will be decomposed into its
    components), the principal axes themselves (in which case it will be assumed the object is currently in its
    principle frame), the principal axes and the orientation, or all 3 (though note that if its all 3 we don't check
    to be sure they're consistent).  Also, note that any parameters beginning with an _ in the init method are primarily
    for pickling/unpickling the object and can mostly be ignored by the user.

        location between the corresponding ray and the ellipsoid.  Anywhere that the rays did not strike the ellipsoid

        find_limbs(self, scan_center_dir, scan_dirs, observer_position=None)

        The method determines the limb points (visible edge of the ellipsoid) that would be an observed for an observer
        located at ``observer_position`` looking toward ``scan_center_dir`` along the directions given by ``scan_dirs``.

        Typically it is assumed that the location of the observer is at the origin of the current frame and therefore
        ``observer_position`` can be left as ``None``.

        The limb for the ellipsoid is found by first solving for the particular solution to the underdetermined system
        of equations

        .. math::

            \left[\begin{array}{c} \mathbf{s}_c^T\mathbf{A}_C \\

            -\left(\mathbf{s}_c\times\mathbf{s}_d\right)^T\mathbf{r} \end{array}\right]

        where :math:`\mathbf{s}_c` is ``scan_center_dir``, :math:`\mathbf{s}_d` is ``scan_dirs``, and :math:`\mathbf{r}`
        is the vector from the observer to the center of the ellipsoid.  Once :math:`\mathbf{p}_0` is solved for, the
        limb can be found by solving the quadratic equation

        .. math::

            ad^2+bd+c=0

        where

        .. math::

            a = \mathbf{p}_h^T\mathbf{A}_C\mathbf{p}_h \\

            c = \mathbf{p}_0^T\mathbf{A}_C\mathbf{p}_0 - 1

        and :math:`\mathbf{p}_h=\mathbf{A}_C\mathbf{r}\times\left(\mathbf{s}_c\times\mathbf{s}_d\right)`.

        Given the 2 solutions to the quadratic equation, the 2 possible limb points are found by
        :math:`\mathbf{p}_0+d\mathbf{p}_h`.  The appropriate solution to use is the one which produces a positive dot
