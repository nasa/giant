"""
This subpackage defines all shapes that are used throughout GIANT.

In GIANT, shapes are used to represent targets in a scene for rendering as well as for other analysis.  Therefore,
shapes enable ray tracing, finding limbs for a target, tracking the location and orientation of a target, among other
things.

There are 2 primary shapes that are typically used to represent targets in GIANT.  These are :class:`.Ellipsoid` and
:class:`.Triangle64` / :class:`.Triangle32`.  :class:`.Ellipsoid` are typically used for "regular" bodies (bodies that
are well modeled by a sphere/triaxial ellipsoid like planets and moons, while :class:`.Triangle64` /
:class:`.Triangle32` are typically used for more general terrain, as well as small patches of terrain from targets that
otherwise are globally ellipsoids.  There are a few other shapes, and the following documentation discusses the typical
use case for each, but generally knowing these 2 is sufficient.

Generally a user probably won't have much direct interaction with this subpackage, as there are many higher level
scripts and modules that handle things for you, like :mod:`.ingest_shape`, :mod:`.tile_shape`,
:mod:`.spc_to_feature_catalog`, and :mod:`.scene`, but understanding what is going on under the hood can be beneficial
so we do recommend at least skimming through this documentation.
