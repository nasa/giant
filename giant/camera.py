"""
This module defines the Camera object for GIANT, which collects information about a camera and images captured by that
camera in a single place and provides some methods for filtering, sorting, and handling the images.

A camera object is used to collect various pieces of data about a camera in a single place, such as a
:class:`.CameraModel`, a list of :class:`.OpNavImage` objects captured by the camera, a function representing the point
spread function of the camera, and some other pieces of information about the camera and images that are used throughout
the other GIANT routines.  By collecting all this data into a single object, the interface for individual components of
GIANT is unified.

In addition to collecting much of the information GIANT requires in a single location, camera objects provide some
capabilities to make managing image sets easier.  These capabilities include things like the ability to turn an image
(or a set of images) off, so it is no longer considered in the GIANT estimation and measurement routines (and also the
ability to turn images back on), the ability to quickly add new images to be considered by only supplying the path to
the files, the ability to override some of the metadata in the images based off of an external file (like the
attitude of the camera), and also the ability to apply a preprocessor to all images (where you can reorient the image,
remove bad pixels, subtract a flat field, etc..).

        This class collects images, the :class:`.CameraModel`, and some relevant metadata about the camera into a single
        object for passing to the GIANT estimators and measurements.

        The :class:`Camera` class is primarily a container for collecting and manipulating images and metadata for a
        single physical camera.  This container is passed to the various measurement and estimation routines
        throughout GIANT to provide them with the requisite images and data needed to complete their tasks. The
        :class:`Camera` object is also an iterator over the images that are turned on.  This means you could do
        something like:

            >>> from giant.camera import Camera
            >>> import numpy
            >>> # generate the image data
            >>> image_list: List[np.ndarray] = [numpy.random.randn(100, 100) for _ in range(10)] 
            >>> # create an instance with the images included
            >>> cam = Camera(images=image_list, parse_data=False)
            >>> # turn off a few of the images
            >>> cam.image_mask[1], cam.image_mask[5], cam.image_mask[8] = False, False, False
            >>> # iterate over the images that are turned on
            >>> for ind, image in cam:
            >>>    print(ind, numpy.array_equal(image_list[ind], image))

            9 True

        The implementation of the Camera object here is fully functional, however, you may want to subclass this
        object for customization purposes.  For instance you may want to implement the :meth:`preprocessor` method to
        apply corrections to images immediately after loading.  You may also want to update the :meth:`image_check`
        method to use a custom :class:`.OpNavImage` subclass instead of the default (alternatively you could override
        the ``default_image_class`` argument to ``__init__``), or provide more custom functionality.

        A function that returns the orientation of the camera frame with respect to the inertial frame as an

        This function is used in two different ways.  First, it can be used to replace the attitude metadata
        in all of the images that are turned on directly using the :meth:`update_attitude_from_function` method.
        This is useful when you are parsing the image metadata from an outdated source (such as the header information
        in a fits file) and want to update the attitude to reflect the most recent attitude knowledge.  Second, this
        function can be used to compute delta quaternions in order to propagate a solved-for attitude from one image to
        another image using the :meth:`update_short_attitude` method.  This is useful when you are taking long-short
        exposure sequences and need to update the attitude of the short images based off of the solved-for attitude
        from the long images.

        In both cases the call to this function passes a datetime object representing the UTC
        time we need the attitude for as the only argument and the function will return the attitude
        as an :class:`.Rotation` object.

        In general, this function is a wrapper around spice calls to retrieve the attitude from a ck file.  GIANT
        provides some helper routines in the :mod:`.spice_interface` module to make it easy to generate this function.
        For instance, we can create a valid function for this attribute using the following:

            >>> from giant.utilities.spice_interface import et_callable_to_datetime_callable
            >>> from giant.utilities.spice_interface import create_callable_orientation
            >>> attitude_function = et_callable_to_datetime_callable(create_callable_orientation('J2000', 'MyNavCam'))

        and then we simply need to ensure we furnish a metakernel that provides enough information to compute the
        transformation from the J2000 inertial frame to the `'MyNavCam'` frame.  See the :mod:`.spice_interface`
        documentation for more information about how this works.

        This method is used to add images to the :attr:`.images` while also ensuring that the :attr:`.image_mask` list
        remains the same size as the :attr:`.images` list.

        This method is the only way that a user should add images to a :class:`Camera` object after the object has been
        initialized.  It ensures that the :attr:`.images` and :attr:`.image_mask` lists do not get out of sync, ensures
        that the new images are turned on (their corresponding :attr:`.image_mask` values are set to ``True``) and also
        interprets the input in order to create an :class:`.OpNavImage` for each instance.

        There are a few different ways you can specify the images to be added to the camera model.  The first, and most
        effective, is to specify a list of strings representing the paths to the files that contain the image
        information.  Similarly, you can specify a single string representing the path to a single image if you only
        want to add one image.  Inputting the image data in this method allows the :class:`.OpNavImage` class to
        retrieve the required metadata for each image, assuming the user has successfully subclassed the
        :class:`.OpNavImage` class and set up the :meth:`.parse_data` method.

        The next most useful way to enter the image data is by entering either a single, or a list of
        :class:`.OpNavImage` objects.  When using this method, the user should be sure that the appropriate metadata
        has been set for each image.

        The least useful way to enter the image data is by entering the raw image data either as a numpy array, a list
        of numpy arrays, or a list of lists of lists.  In each of these cases, the data contained in the arrays/inner
        lists of lists is interpreted directly as the imaging data and no metadata is attached to the created
        :class:`.OpNavImage` object.  The user must the be sure to go an enter the correct metadata for each image
        to ensure functionality is not broken for other GIANT routines.

        Regardless of how the image data is entered, this method expands the :attr:`.image_mask` list by the number of
        images that are being added and turns each of the new images on.  In addition, if the ``preprocessor`` argument
        is set to ``True`` the :meth:`preprocessor` method is called on each image before it is stored in the
        :attr:`.images` list.

        If you are entering the image data as a string or a list of strings then you can optionally turn off the
        `parse_data` functionality by setting the ``parse_data`` keyword argument to ``False``.  This is not recommended
        however.

        This method updates the attitude metadata for short exposure images based off of the solved for attitudes in
        the long-exposure images.

        There are three different techniques that you can use to update the short exposure attitudes which are selected
        using the `method` key word argument.  The first technique, ``'propagate'``, "propagates" the attitude
        from a long exposure image to the short exposure image using a delta quaternion.  The delta quaternion is
        calculated using the :attr:`.attitude_function` and is computed using

        .. math::
            \delta\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{q}_{sf}\otimes\mathbf{q}_{lf}^{-1}

        where :math:`\delta\mathbf{q}` is the delta quaternion, :math:`\mathbf{q}_{sf}` is the attitude quaternion
        at the short exposure image time according to the :attr:`.attitude_function`, :math:`\mathbf{q}_{lf}^{-1}` is
        the inverse of the attitude quaternion for the long exposure image closest (in time) to the short exposure
        image according to the :attr:`.attitude_function`, and :math:`\otimes` is quaternion multiplication.  The delta
        quaternion is applied according to

        .. math::
            \mathbf{q}_{ss}=\delta\mathbf{q}\otimes\mathbf{q}_{ls}

        where :math:`\mathbf{q}_{ss}` is the solved for attitude for the short exposure image and
        :math:`\mathbf{q}_{ls}` is the solved for attitude for the long exposure image closest (in time) to the short
        exposure image.  This means that to use this method short exposure images must be either preceded or followed by
        a long exposure image in the :attr:`.images` list.

        The next potential method is ``'interpolate'``.  In interpolate, the attitude of a short exposure image that is
        sandwiched between 2 long exposure images is updated by using the SLERP quaternion interpolation method.  The
        SLERP quaternion interpolation method is described in :func:`.slerp` function documentation.  In order to use
        the ``'interpolate'`` method all turned on short exposure images must be immediately preceded and followed by
        long exposure images.

        The final potential method is ``'replace'``.  In the ``'replace'`` method, the attitude for short exposure
        images are replaced with the attitude from the closest (in time) long exposure image to them from the
        :attr:`.images` list.  In order to use the `'replace`' method every turned on short exposure image must be
        preceded or followed by a long exposure image.

        If we are successful at updating a short exposure image using this method, then the
        :attr:`.OpNavImage.pointing_post_fit` flag is updated to be ``True`` for the corresponding image.
        Otherwise it is set to ``False``.

        .. note::
            The attitude is only updated for "short" exposure images that are turned on (it does not matter if the long
            exposure images are turned on or off).
