r"""
Provides abstract base classes for the construction of Point Spread Function classes for GIANT.

In this module there are a number of abstract base classes (ABCs) that define the interface for and provide some common
functionality for point spread functions (PSFs) in GIANT.  In general, most users will not interact with these directly,
and will instead use a predefined implementation of a PSF, however, if you wish to define a new PSF for GIANT to use
then you will likely benefit from what is available in this module.

To define a new PSF you will most likely want to subclass at least one of the ABCs defined in this module, which will
help you to be sure you've defined all the interfaces GIANT expects and possibly add some shared functionality so that
you don't need to reinvent the wheel.  However, this is not strictly necessary.  While type checkers will complain if
you don't at least inherit from :class:`PointSpreadFunction`, GIANT will not actually error so long as you have defined
all the appropriate interfaces (so called duck typing).

Use
---

To implement a fully function custom PSF for GIANT you must at minimum implement the following methods and attributes

================================================= ======================================================================
Method/Attribute                                  Use
================================================= ======================================================================
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.save_residuals`       A class attribute which determines whether to save information about
                                                  the residuals from attempting to fit the PSF to data.  If ``True``
                                                  then you should save the residual statistics and formal fit
                                                  covariance.
:meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.__call__`             The built in call method for the class.  This method should apply the
                                                  defined PSF in the current instance to a 2D image, returning the image
                                                  after the PSF has been applied.
:meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.apply_1d`             An analogous method to :meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.__call__` but for
                                                  applying the PSF to (a) 1D scan line(s) instead of a 2D image.
:meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.generate_kernel`      A method that generates a square unit kernel (sums to 1) of the
                                                  current instance of the PSF.
:meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.evaluate`             A method that evaluates the current instance of the PSF at provided
                                                  x and y locations
:meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.fit`                  A class method which fits an instance of the PSF to supplied data and
                                                  returns and initialized version of the PSF with the fit parameters.
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.centroid`             A property which returns the location of the peak of the PSF as a
                                                  as a length 2 numpy array.
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.residual_rss`         A property which returns the root sum of squares of the rss of the fit
                                                  of the PSF iff the current instance was made by a call to
                                                  :meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.fit` and
                                                  :attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.save_residuals` is ``True``.  If either of
                                                  these are not True then returns ``None``.
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.residual_std`         A property which returns the standard deviation of the rss of the fit
                                                  of the PSF iff the current instance was made by a call to
                                                  :meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.fit` and
                                                  :attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.save_residuals` is ``True``.  If either of
                                                  these are not True then returns ``None``.
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.covariance`           A property which returns the formal covariance of the fit
                                                  of the PSF iff the current instance was made by a call to
                                                  :meth:`~PointSpreadFunction.fit` and
                                                  :attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.save_residuals` is ``True``.  If either of
                                                  these are not True then returns ``None``.
:attr:`~PointSpreadFunction.volume`               A method which computes the total volume under the PSF (integral from
                                                  :math:`-\inf` to :math:`\inf`)
================================================= ======================================================================

Implementing these, plus whatever else is needed internally for the functionality of the PSF, will result in a PSF class
that can be used throughout GIANT.

For examples of how this is done, refer to the pre-defined PSFs in :mod:`.gaussians`.

    This abstract base class serves as the template for implementing a point spread function in GIANT.

    A point spread function models how a camera spreads out a point source of light across multiple pixels in an image.

    centroiding of stars and unresolved bodies for center finding (:mod:`.unresolved`), attitude estimation
    (:mod:`.stellar_opnav`), and camera calibration (:mod:`.calibration`).

        Performs iterative non-linear least squares on a PSF model until convergence has been reached for a function of
        the form :math:`z=f(x, y)`

        Iterative non-linear least squares is performed by linearizing at each step about the current best estimate of
        the state.  This means that for each iteration, the Jacobian matrix is computed based off the current best
        estimate of the state, and then used to form a linear approximation of the model using a Taylor expansion.
        The resulting estimate is a delta from the current state, so that it is typically applied by adding the
        resulting update state vector to the existing states (although in some instances such as for rotations, a more
        complicated update application may be needed.

        Iterative non-linear least squares typically needs an adequate initial guess to ensure convergence, therefore,
        it is recommended that the state of the class be appropriately initialized before calling this method (what is
        appropriate is dependent on the PSF itself.

        The iteration performed in this method can be controlled using the :attr:`max_iter`, :attr:`atol`, and
        :attr:`rtol` class attributes which control the maximum number of iterations to attempt for convergence, the
        absolute tolerance criteria for convergence, and the relative tolerance criteria for convergence respectively.

        This method use :meth:`compute_jacobian` to return the Jacobian matrix for the current estimate of the state
        vector and :meth:`update_state` to apply the estimated update at each iteration step, therefore, these methods
        should expect the same order of state elements.

        If the iteration diverges then this method will call :meth:`update_state` with ``None`` as the argument, which
        should typically indicate that the state parameters should be set to NaN so that other GIANT algorithms are
