"""
Defines PSF subclasses for representing/fitting various forms of 2D Gaussian functions.

Note that in this module we assume that the resulting illumination profile for a point source as captured by a detector
is Gaussian, which is not strictly true.  In actuality, if the PSF is well modelled by a Gaussian function then the
captured profile will be integrals of the portions of the Gaussian contained within each pixel.  These integrals are not
easily defined which makes fitting much more cumbersome and cost intensive (requiring numeric approximations for the
Jacobians).  In general, however, particularly for a well sampled PSF (where the FWHM is larger than the
pixel pitch of the detector), this distinction is negligible, particularly when it comes to estimating the centroid of
the PSF, which is typically our primary goal.  Providing integrated Gaussian PSFs for extra precise estimation is
something that is currently under development.

    :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the centroid of the Gaussian (location of the peak response).

    This is equivalent to a function of the form

    direction.

    When creating an instance of this class you can specify either ``a, b, c`` or ``sigma_x, sigma_y, theta`` and the
    class will convert and store appropriately.  This class also allows you to retrieve either ``a, b, c`` or
    ``sigma_x, sigma_y, theta``.

    This class can be used for both estimating a Gaussian fit to an observed PSF (using the :meth:`fit` class method to
    create an instance) as well as for applying the represented PSF to 1D scan lines (using :meth:`apply_1d) and 2D
    images (using the *call* capabilities of an instance of this class).  In addition, if generated from a fit to data,
    this class will store the residuals and statistics about the residuals of the fit if the class attribute
    :attr:`save_residuals` is set to True before calling :meth:`fit`.
