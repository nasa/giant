    This class implements a fully functional PSF object for GIANT, however, because it does not actually model how light
    is spread out, if applied to an image or scan lines it just returns the input unaltered.  Also, since this isn't
    actually an estimation, the covariance and residuals are undefined so these are always set to NaN.
