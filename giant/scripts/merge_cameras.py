Merge camera files together into a single file.

Camera files are assumed to be stored in dill or pickle files and are store in a dill file.  The camera files should
contain the same :class:`.Camera` class with different images.  This script does not enforce this though so be careful
as you may experience unexpected results if you try to merge files containing different :class:`.Camera` classes.

.. warning::

    This script loads/saves some results from/to python pickle files.  Pickle files can be used to execute arbitrary
    code, so you should never open one from an untrusted source.
